# yesterday_weather

A small program that connects to weather underground and uses their api to gather information about the previous day.
That info is then used to calculate the [heat units](http://sandhillpreservation.com/pages/sweetpotato_catalog.html) 
and record them in a sqlite database.  The goal of this program is to help determine when sweet potatoes can be harvested.
According to sand hill preservation it takes about 1200 heat units to ripen an early sweet potato variety.
